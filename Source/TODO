- Able to reload engines:
  - Merge Edit and Play into Boot
  - games can have arguments if they want.

** let's DSL everything. honestly.
 -haskell types.
 - need parsec  ? real world haskell www





---------------- DEV -----------------

- use viewport as the winding bounds size when clearing procedural
- actually, we have to just re-render the winding filled with max Z.
   (also written below in 'notes')

- smart triangulation of windings
- polygon clipping to screen (save vtx,texcoord,color) when rendering?
- use glRect, heheheehrherhehehehe

- bytestring-lexing for Data.ByteString.Lex.Double
- 'binary' package for Data.Binary using bytestring

MAKE.
HUMASECT.
LOGO.
IN..
EDITOR.

--------------- AUDIO ----------------

- Procedural uses images/models
- Synth uses sounds/models ..

--------------- EDITOR ---------------

- inverted curves
	- curves for shading
	- also for making corners and such
- sometimes we want AutoCurve to happen before procedural, other times we want it to happen after
  mutators ...
- Combiner/Performance

- ok, for mutators in browser: left click is "set current" (for anims and whatnot)
  and right click is "apply to geometry" like freeze it in.
- should there be no 'trans' in parts? ie. if it just uses the current mutation on selected parts for 'preview'..
	-naw.


** Editor

- make OldWinding.hs so both Editor and BuildContent can use it
- saving and loading is kind of lame. we dont really need it.
- persistent save...save save save ... keep like 20 backups. nice undo too if needed.
- test models in editor, render as green+0.5alpha
- does not quit properly in Windows when clicking close button.

** UI

- add string lengths max for EditLabels . see "lblPattern" in Browser.hs
- Move current withContents into browse panel to see.
- allow to build a withContents in browse panel, and to name it, and save in file contents.nhs.
- able to edit and view contents completely in editor
- Highlight selected contents

- modelbutton for showing borders
- click on "75%" should reset to 100%.
- windingbutton for set colors 0% 50% 100%
- right click and left click on grid too, to smaller and bigger of it ?
- validate label editing, show red box when readIO fails on subjective type
	- edit text of u,v,r,g,b,a in steps
	- color editors
- read each line in safeReadScript to show line where parse error occurs.
- reset lastCursor when enter/exit the panels.
- we can still drag when inside panels..


** Winding/Part

- move collision for Parts into Dynamics/Winding
- dragging UVs have less increments the greater the grid size. this is because they are simulating texture size.
  what should be done? cursor size? or just invert
	- same in calcPartUV/calcStepUV.
- able to scale UVs uniform
- cut tool to cut selected polygons (75%)
- Double Click to add vertices to winding (within cursorR) .. start winding too? ..
- um, clean up "rotateContentsBy" and "moveContentsBy" -- using RImage and RModel
- rotations from cursor and from center of winding.
- select by u,v texlines
- export RModel in selection by winding flag .. ?
	- we will have like shift+rclick for making a part, but this part will be made normally,
	then it is flagged, and the model is exported as such (add button next to flags in panel,
	called 'export with')
- drag yellow part bounds to shear

** Rendering

- instead of drawing models in editor, draw names. we use them for music/fx too, and can be quite intrusive.
- when rendering model as Smaller, have it relative to model size of course; also translation has errors.
- render uncolored wireframe...
- text procedural

----------------------------  notes --------

- we clear the depth buffer after each proc render, because they can overlap. grid lines for example.
  we can clear with viewport set to winding bounds. we can also try to reset that place of depth buffer just
  like how we set it up in the first place to render the procedurals. (also written above)

- user can make concave after making windings. i like it this way because it enforces concentration, and a 
  certain kind of creativity and so many things. one can get lazy with ability for "any polygon",
  instead of using potential creativities.

- for select with making winding, cannot select unless points are inside either/or. do not worry about things like
  crossing +'s where no points are in any other. because there is no edge collide for windings (we can add..)

------------- later -----------------

- BuildContents doesn't know if something was deleted or not. (moved/renamed)

- i am not sure if i like the disappearing panels.

- add a view to see textures or hear sounds.

- able to import model into current model.(Editor.Operations.reloadFile)

- add "make auto concave to convex" in making menu, only when is concave.

- editor does not need to findAllResourceDirs/resNames while rendering the browser while moving mouse.
	- we can cache this in RScript/browser.nhs or something.

- use GLFW ? may not work with threads/shell/doubleclick
